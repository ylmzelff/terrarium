notes:
- SmartGrid baseline configuration (no attacks)
- SmartGrid creates a single global blackboard for all homes to coordinate power usage
- SmartGrid environment coordinates power-consuming task scheduling across homes
- Homes coordinate via blackboards to minimize total main grid draw
- Each home has 2-4 power-consuming tasks from the device catalog
- Tasks must be scheduled within their allowed time windows
- Sustainable capacity varies sinusoidally over 24-hour period
- 'Objective: Minimize peak consumption and main grid energy usage'
- Simulation stops when all tasks scheduled optimally or max iterations reached
- Device catalog includes EVs, appliances, and various home devices with realistic
  power consumption
