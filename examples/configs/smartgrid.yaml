notes:
- SmartGrid baseline configuration (no attacks)
- SmartGrid creates a single global blackboard for all agents to coordinate assignments
- Agents assign each owned machine to a shared renewable source
- Coordinate via blackboards to minimize overflow to the main grid
- Each agent controls 2-4 machines with fixed operating windows
- Sources have hourly capacities shared across agents
- Objective: Maximize CoLLAB v2 global reward (minimize overflow)
- Simulation stops when all machines assigned or max iterations reached
