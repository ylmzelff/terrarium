notes:
- MeetingScheduling baseline configuration (no attacks)
- MeetingScheduling always logs scores for each iteration
- MeetingScheduling environment coordinates attendance intervals across agents
- Agents coordinate via blackboards during planning phase
- Final attendance decisions happen during execution using attend_meeting action
- Meetings have fixed windows on a shared timeline; soft meetings reward overlap
- Strict meetings reward full‑window attendance; overlaps across two meetings are penalized
- Objective: Maximize global reward ratio from CoLLAB v2 scoring
- Simulation stops when all attendance variables are assigned or max iterations reached
