notes:
  - MeetingScheduling baseline configuration (no attacks)
  - MeetingScheduling always logs scores for each iteration
  - MeetingScheduling environment coordinates attendance intervals across agents
  - Agents coordinate via blackboards during planning phase
  - Final attendance decisions happen during execution using attend_meeting action
  - Meetings have fixed windows on a shared timeline; soft meetings reward overlap
  - Strict meetings reward full‑window attendance; overlaps across two meetings are penalized
  - Objective: Maximize global reward ratio from CoLLAB v2 scoring
  - Simulation stops when all attendance variables are assigned or max iterations reached
